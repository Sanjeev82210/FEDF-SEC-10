Steps to Create and Merge a Branch into dev in Git
Creating a New Branch

To create a new branch and switch to it:

```
git checkout -b <branch-name>
Replace <branch-name> with your desired name (e.g., feature1).

```

Merging Your Branch into dev

Switch to the dev branch:
```
git checkout dev
Pull the latest updates for dev:

```

```
git pull
Merge your feature branch into dev:

```

```
git merge <branch-name>
Replace <branch-name> with the name of your branch.
```

Resolve Conflicts (if any):

If there are conflicts, edit the files to resolve them.

After resolving, commit the changes.
